## We tried to predict the Interest Rate in New York State for Mortgages.

Current models used by banks to assign credit risk are currently archaic and not public knowledge. This project aims to create a quasi model of what interest rate determination should look like to develop the model ourselves. This project would like to use the personal details of a person and non-conventional attributes to predict the type of interest rate to give. This project could be useful in managing risk as a lender to a borrower. Further the transparency of such a model gives us insight into what goes into interest rates.
- Credit score
- Home Location
- Home price and loan amount
- down payment
- loan term
- interest rate type
- Loan type 

This project aims to predict the interest rate spread in  New York using data from 2021. Interest rate spread is the difference between the interest rate that is offered and the national interest rate.  The data set used was from Home Mortgage Disclosure Act 2021.

## Data

Data was retrieved from [FFIEC CFPB Derived Data Fields Documentation](https://ffiec.cfpb.gov/documentation/2021/derived-data-fields/). It was cleaned for proper use described in the notebook review.

## Model

Different type of Machine Learning models were tried in this project. They are provided in the notebook and final results are provided below.


## Results

The Mean Squared Error of our final linear regression model is 0.08630384434852473. Our final R-squared is 0.8238190063408363. This is better than our initial 0.797 model raw linear regression, so we are happy with the results, especially for a model that has not been run before.  This was the Linear regression model with the best results from GridSearch in the above cell. Linear Regression and standard edition to the model prove a better performing model overall.
